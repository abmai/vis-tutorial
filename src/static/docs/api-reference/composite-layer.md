# CompositeLayer Class

The `CompositeLayer` class is a subclass of the
[Layer Class](/docs/api-reference/base-layer.md), with its own implementation
of certain
[layer lifecycle methods](/docs/advanced/layer-lifecycle.md)
to help create sublayers and handle events.

If you intend to implement a layer that generates other layers, it is recommended
that you extend this class.

## Methods

##### `draw`

A composite layer does not render directly into the WebGL context.
The `draw` method inherited from the base class is therefore never called.

##### `renderLayers`

Allows a layer to "render" or insert one or more deck.gl layers after itself.
Called after a layer has been updated.

Returns:
- `null`, a single `Layer` instance, or an array of layers.

The default implementation of `renderLayers` returns `null`.


##### `getPickingInfo`

Called when a sublayer is being hovered or clicked, after the `getPickingInfo`
of the sublayer has been called.
The composite layer can override or add additional fields to the `info` object
that will be passed to the callbacks.

Parameters:

- `pickParams` (Object)
  * `pickParams.info` (Object) - The current `info` object. By default it contains the
  following fields:
    + `x` (Number) - Mouse position x relative to the viewport.
    + `y` (Number) - Mouse position y relative to the viewport.
    + `lngLat` ([Number, Number]) - Mouse position in world coordinates. Only applies if
      [`projectionMode`](/docs/api-reference/base-layer.md#-projectionmode-number-optional-)
      is `COORDINATE_SYSTEM.LNGLAT`.
    + `color` (Number[4]) - The color of the pixel that is being picked. It represents a
      "picking color" that is encoded by
      [`layer.encodePickingColor()`](/docs/api-reference/base-layer.md#-encodepickingcolor-).
    + `index` (Number) - The index of the object that is being picked. It is the returned
      value of
      [`layer.dncodePickingColor()`](/docs/api-reference/base-layer.md#-decodepickingcolor-).
    + `picked` (Boolean) - `true` if `index` is not `-1`.
  * `pickParams.mode` (String) - One of `hover` and `click`
  * `pickParams.sourceLayer` (Layer) - the sublayer instance where this event originates from.

Returns:

- An `info` object with optional fields about what was picked.
This object will be passed to the layer's `onHover` or `onClick` callbacks.
- `null`, if the corresponding event should cancelled with no callback
functions called.

The default implementation returns `pickParams.info` without any change.
