# SolidPolygonLayer

The SolidPolygon Layer renders filled polygons.

```js
import DeckGL, {SolidPolygonLayer} from 'deck.gl';

new PolygonLayer({
  data: [
    [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 0], [0, 0]],   // Simple polygon (array of coords)
    [                                           // Complex polygon with one hole
      [[0, 0], [0, 2], [2, 2], [2, 0], [0, 0]], // (array of array of coords)
      [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 0], [0, 0]]
    ]
  ]
});
```

* The polypgons can be simple or complex (complex polygons are polygons with holes).
* A simple polygon specified as an array of vertices, each vertice being an array
  of two or three numbers
* A complex polygon is specified as an array of simple polygons, the
  first polygon representing the outer outline, and the remaining polygons
  representing holes. These polygons are expected to not intersect.

## Properties

Inherits from all [Base Layer](/docs/api-reference/base-layer.md) properties.

### Render Options

##### `extruded` (Boolean, optional)

- Default: `false`

Whether to extrude the polygons (based on the elevations provided by the
`getElevation` accessor. If set to false, all polygons will be flat, this
generates less geometry and is faster than simply returning `0` from `getElevation`.

##### `wireframe` (Boolean, optional)

- Default: `false`

Whether to generate a line wireframe of the hexagon. The outline will have
"horizontal" lines closing the top and bottom polygons and a vertical line
(a "strut") for each vertex on the polygon.

**Remarks:**

* These lines are rendered with `GL.LINE` and will thus always be 1 pixel wide.
* Wireframe and solid extrusions are exclusive, you'll need to create two layers
  with the same data if you want a combined rendering effect.

##### `lightSettings` (Object, optional

**EXPERIMENTAL**

This is an object that contains light settings for extruded polygons.
Be aware that this prop will likely be changed in a future version of deck.gl.

### Data Accessors

##### `getPolygon` (Function, optional)

- default: object => object

Like any deck.gl layer, the polygon accepts a data prop which is expected to
be an iterable container of objects, and an accessor
that extracts a polygon (simple or complex) from each object.

This accessor returns the polygon corresponding to an object in the `data` stream.

##### `getColor` (Function, optional)

The fill color for the polygon

##### `getElevation` (Function, optional)

- Default: `object => object.elevation`

Method called to retrieve the elevation of each object's polygon.

If a cartographic projection mode is used, height will be interpreted as meters,
otherwise will be in unit coordinates.

## Remarks

* This layer only renders filled polygons. If you need to render polygon
  outlines, use the [`PathLayer`](/docs/layers/path-layer.md)
* Polygons are always closed, i.e. there is an implicit line segment between
  the first and last vertices, when those vertices are not equal.
* The specification of complex polygons intentionally follows the GeoJson
  conventions for representing polugons with holes.
